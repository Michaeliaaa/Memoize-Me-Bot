# Memoize-Me-Bot
Memoize Me Bot is a self-initiated project started by Michaelia and Caitlin for Orbital (a.k.a., CP2106: Independent Software Development Project). It serves as a practical study bot that can be used by many (students, teaching assistants and lecturers) to test understanding of important concepts that are being taught. It can be used to quiz yourself or to manage your flashcards. The bot can be used on Telegram at `@MemoizeMeBot`.
